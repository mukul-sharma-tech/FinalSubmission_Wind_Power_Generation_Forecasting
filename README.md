Weather Power Forecasting Project
Project Overview
This project aims to forecast power generation based on weather conditions using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes various weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and wind direction across different locations. By analyzing the relationship between these weather features and power generation, we can build a model to predict power output.

Learning Objectives
Understand the Impact of Weather on Power Generation: Learn how various weather parameters influence power generation.

Data Merging and Preprocessing: Combine multiple datasets and clean them for machine learning.

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize data distributions, relationships, and patterns.

Feature Engineering: Create meaningful features for better model performance.

Build and Train Machine Learning Models: Use regression models like Linear Regression for power forecasting.

Evaluate Model Performance: Assess the accuracy of the model using metrics like MSE and R² score.

Interpret Model Results: Analyze feature importance to understand the factors affecting power generation.

Tools and Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language.

Libraries:

pandas for data manipulation.

numpy for numerical operations.

matplotlib, seaborn for data visualization.

scikit-learn for machine learning and model evaluation.

Steps
1. Data Merging and Preprocessing
Merge multiple datasets: Combine data from different locations and clean the dataset.

Feature Engineering: Encode categorical features like location and categorize wind direction into buckets.

Missing Data Handling: Ensure there are no missing values in the dataset.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Histograms: To visualize the distribution of weather features.

Scatter Plots: To explore relationships between temperature and power generation.

Box Plots: To identify outliers and understand feature distributions.

3. Model Training and Evaluation
Linear Regression: Build a regression model to predict power generation using weather features.

Train-Test Split: Split the data into training and testing sets.

Model Performance: Evaluate using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.

Feature Importance: Analyze the coefficients to determine which features impact power generation the most.

4. Visualization
Visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and box plots help explore data patterns and model results.

Results
Predicted vs Actual Power: Displays how well the model’s predictions match the actual power generation.

Feature Importance: Shows the impact of weather parameters on power generation.
